#Develop a function to check whether a given number is prime or not.
#Use a loop to try dividing the number by all integers from 2 up
#to the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any number
#other than 1 and itself, it is not prime.


#function definition
def isPrime(num):
    prime = True #
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            prime = False
    return prime
    
 

result = isPrime(20) #funtion call
print("can this number prime?:", result)
